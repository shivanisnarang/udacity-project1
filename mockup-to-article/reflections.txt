You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

* Learnt about the new tags (superscript, strikethrough etc) and their implementation.
* The way the prior content was presented, it made it easier for me to implement the things which i had learnt in the videos.
* Nothing really so far.
* Wherever i got stuck, i referred the mozilla documentation to pass through it.
